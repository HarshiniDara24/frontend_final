      "analysis": "The defect summary indicates that there is an issue with missing policy details in the Kafka response for the Policy Lookup Service. This issue is causing downstream systems to fail while retrieving policy details. \n\nThe root cause of this issue can be explained as follows:\n1. The problem occurs due to a missing field mapping between the MongoDB document and the Kafka producer payload format.\n2. The policy number was not included in the Kafka message, which caused errors related to missing fields in payloads.\n3. This was identified from the logs showing errors related to missing fields in payloads, indicating a discrepancy in the data being sent to Kafka.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the following steps can be taken:\n1. Update the MongoDB query to ensure that the missing policy number field is included.\n2. Modify the Kafka producer logic to map the policy number field correctly.\n3. Test these changes in the QA environment using various policy scenarios to ensure the fix is working as expected.\n4. Deploy the fix to production after successful testing, and monitor the system for any performance impact.\n\nThe importance of resolving this issue lies in ensuring that downstream systems receive complete policy details as expected, preventing any failures or errors.\n\nFor tracking and referencing purposes, the JIRA ID for this defect is SCRUM-7, and the JIRA URL is https://nish09.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-7. If you face any doubts or roadblocks, you can reach out to the previous defect owner, Nishanth Anbazhagan, for further assistance.\n\nPlease note that the response provided is based solely on the available dataset and is intended to offer guidance.

      "defectSummary": "Missing policy details in Kafka response for Downstream Service.",
      "analysis": "The defect summary indicates that there is an issue with missing policy details in the Kafka response for the downstream service. This issue is causing failures in the downstream systems that rely on this information. \n\nThe root cause of this issue can be explained as follows:\n1. A race condition exists between the policy data update process and the Kafka producer, where the MongoDB document is being updated asynchronously.\n2. The Kafka producer is fetching the policy details before the update is committed to the database, resulting in outdated or incomplete policy details being sent to Kafka.\n3. This issue is confirmed by analyzing the logs and database timestamps, which show a delay between the update and Kafka message generation.\n\nTo resolve this issue, the following steps can be taken:\n1. Implement a retry mechanism in the Kafka producer to fetch the latest policy details from MongoDB before sending messages.\n2. Introduce a delay to ensure that the database update process is completed before the Kafka message generation.\n3. Validate these fixes in the QA environment under different load conditions to ensure that the solution works as expected.\n4. After successful testing, deploy the solution to production to prevent further incidents.\n\nThe issue was previously tracked and resolved under the JIRA ID SCRUM-13, which can be found at https://nish09.atlassian.net/browse/SCRUM-13. The JIRA ID is important for tracking and referencing purposes, and the JIRA URL can be used to access the issue details and history.
